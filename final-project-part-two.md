# Wireframes / Storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

Original Exposition: Introduce some of the recent musical films from the past decade.

**Updated Exposition** : 
Begin with the inspiration for this project and a sort of executive summary for what is to come. I will still use this time to introduce some of the recent musical films from the past decade, but I will not go into much detail so that their data can be analyzed later on. I will spend a lot of this time discussing the significant history of musicals on the film industry from the early 1900s. I will discuss the decline and then eventual rise of these films in American cinema. 
 - Reference "Wicked," since this was a recent musical adaptation that most of the audience would be familiar with

Original Rising Action: Highlight the financial and critical acclaim of these projects.

 - We can see strong box office data to prove the benefit of these films. Include the IMDB ratings of these projects as well.

**Updated Rising Action** :
In this section, I will still begin by breaking down the financial ability of a musical film. I have created a visualization showing a handful of the most popular musical films and how they performed at the domestic and international levels. I will rely on the box office data I have gathered and explore musical films as a major moneymaker for theaters. I will briefly discuss the struggles of movie theaters and how musicals can be source of relief in these trying times for the industry. 

Original Climax: Explore the financial, critical and cultural success of "Wicked." Discuss the success of recorded releases of on-stage productions (seen with "Hamilton," and now with "Merrily We Roll Along.")

-Place emphasis on the dual-nature of this success, as the box-office wins are also evident in the corresponding Broadway/West End productions.

**Updated Climax** :
This section has not changed much, as this is a fairly straightforward breakdown of the ticket sales. I want to push the idea that musicals are not just great financially, but also have a large impact on society and the critical acclaim of a project. Films have a much larger audience than musicals, which gives more people access to the work. I will include a very effective data visualization at this point, which shows how we can compare record sales of the musical vs. film recordings. The data I have found shows that film recordings have much greater success than the source material. 

Original Conflict: Explore the negative reviews or perspectives about musical films.

In this section, I will look into the negative feedback from some films, as many audiences find that some works do not translate as well to the big screen. Also consider the opinion that musical films take away sales from stage productions.

**Updated Conflict** :
Using the data from the previous graphic on cast recordings, I will transition into a discussion on the critiques of musical films. I will use examples from data such as "Dear Evan Hansen," or "Cats," as these are films with low box office and IMDB ratings. These examples are valid critiques, which may have slightly tarnished the success of these works. I want to make it clear that these works being unsuccessful is not representative of the whole industry, but rather adaptation/casting issues. 

Original Resolution:

To finish our story, I will address the future of musical films and all the success that is soon to come.

**Updated Resolution** :
I will still follow this original plan, but I want to look into data forecasts for films in production or to come. I also want to briefly reference the data on screen to stage adaptations, as there is great success in that relationship, as well. 

Original Call to Action:

Discuss the importance of supporting theaters and entertainment at all levels. Encourage production of musicals both on stage and on screen. Focus on employing actors and directors from the stage to keep that connection present in film musicals.

**Updated Call to Action** :
At this point I am sticking with my original call to action. However, I am not committed to it and would like to add more to this concept if something else comes to me as I continue to develop the story.
