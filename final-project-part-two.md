# Wireframes / Storyboards

Original Exposition: Introduce some of the recent musical films from the past decade.

**Updated Exposition** : 
Begin with the inspiration for this project and a sort of executive summary for what is to come. I will still use this time to introduce some of the recent musical films from the past decade, but I will not go into much detail so that their data can be analyzed later on. I will spend a lot of this time discussing the significant history of musicals on the film industry from the early 1900s. I will discuss the decline and then eventual rise of these films in American cinema. 
 - Reference "Wicked," since this was a recent musical adaptation that most of the audience would be familiar with

Original Rising Action: Highlight the financial and critical acclaim of these projects.

 - We can see strong box office data to prove the benefit of these films. Include the IMDB ratings of these projects as well.

**Updated Rising Action** :
In this section, I will still begin by breaking down the financial ability of a musical film. I have created a visualization showing a handful of the most popular musical films and how they performed at the domestic and international levels. I will rely on the box office data I have gathered and explore musical films as a major moneymaker for theaters. I will briefly discuss the struggles of movie theaters and how musicals can be source of relief in these trying times for the industry. 

Original Climax: Explore the financial, critical and cultural success of "Wicked." Discuss the success of recorded releases of on-stage productions (seen with "Hamilton," and now with "Merrily We Roll Along.")

-Place emphasis on the dual-nature of this success, as the box-office wins are also evident in the corresponding Broadway/West End productions.

**Updated Climax** :
This section has not changed much, as this is a fairly straightforward breakdown of the ticket sales. I want to push the idea that musicals are not just great financially, but also have a large impact on society and the critical acclaim of a project. Films have a much larger audience than musicals, which gives more people access to the work. I will include a very effective data visualization at this point, which shows how we can compare record sales of the musical vs. film recordings. The data I have found shows that film recordings have much greater success than the source material. 

Original Conflict: Explore the negative reviews or perspectives about musical films.

In this section, I will look into the negative feedback from some films, as many audiences find that some works do not translate as well to the big screen. Also consider the opinion that musical films take away sales from stage productions.

**Updated Conflict** :
Using the data from the previous graphic on cast recordings, I will transition into a discussion on the critiques of musical films. I will use examples from data such as "Dear Evan Hansen," or "Cats," as these are films with low box office and IMDB ratings. These examples are valid critiques, which may have slightly tarnished the success of these works. I want to make it clear that these works being unsuccessful is not representative of the whole industry, but rather adaptation/casting issues. 

Original Resolution:

To finish our story, I will address the future of musical films and all the success that is soon to come.

**Updated Resolution** :
I will still follow this original plan, but I want to look into data forecasts for films in production or to come. I also want to briefly reference the data on screen to stage adaptations, as there is great success in that relationship, as well. 

Original Call to Action:

Discuss the importance of supporting theaters and entertainment at all levels. Encourage production of musicals both on stage and on screen. Focus on employing actors and directors from the stage to keep that connection present in film musicals.

**Updated Call to Action** :
At this point I am sticking with my original call to action. However, I am not committed to it and would like to add more to this concept if something else comes to me as I continue to develop the story. 


# User Research 

## Target Audience

General Audience: The general audience for this story would be the people in our classroom who will be viewing the presentation. These individuals are people in graduate school who have an interest in data and how it impacts the decisions we make in our respective fields. Although the general audience may not be in the entertainment industry, it is made up of young people. These people are most likely casual consumers of entertainment. I hope that this audience will find the data interesting, as it influences the type of media they consume. 
Industry Audience: This audience would be the target for this story, as I am hoping to reach those working in film development/acquisitions. These are the people who make decisions about which works make it to the big screen, so this data would be beneficial for them as it tells the story of why musical films are so important at this point in time. 

With these two audiences as the target for this story, I aimed to interview individuals from all sorts of backgrounds. I wanted to make sure I was getting feedback from people with technical and creative interests, as this would provide the most relevant recommendation. I cannot interview industry professionals, but I made an effort to interview someone in the MEIM program who has a lot of background knowledge. 

Interview 1: Female, early 20s, MSPPM-DA student, casual movie viewer
Interview 2: Male, early 20s, MISM student
Interview 3: Female, early 20s, MEIM student, focus on talent management and casting

## Interview Script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Continue to develop and strengthen the call to action     |    Did the call to action feel like a satisfying end to the story?              |
| Determine how the story could be made more interesting     |       Do you have any ideas for how to make this story stand out?           |
| See if the story flows properly and makes sense to the audience   |   What is your initial reaction to the storyline and how it develops throughout?               |



## Interview Findings

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Did the call to action feel like a satisfying end to the story?  |  I don't think that it stands out very much. It is fine but does not provide much to the story.           |   I don't know too much about this topic but I think that the ending makes sense and wraps things up nicely.          |   I think it's a good start, but I would like to see something about encouraging the audience to see more musicals and push their own expectations of what a musical can be.          |
| Do you have any ideas for how to make this story stand out?    |  I think you could add some of your own opinions to the story, especially the beginning.                             | I also think this is a cool topic. You could add a data visualization on the global success of these films.         |   You could make this your own by adding data on certain genres and how they succeed.          |
| What is your initial reaction to the storyline and how it develops throughout?       | I think this is a good idea and everything flows in a very effective way.                               |  I am not as familiar with this information, so this story is different and fun for me.           |  I am aware of a lot of this data already since I study this, but I think you provide a really helpful and effective overview of the topic.           |

After completing the interviews and talking with individuals from different backgrounds, I feel like I received helpful feedback and opinions. The in-class interviews I conducted were the most helpful for me, because these people are not in my program and do not have a vested interest in entertainment. Therefore, their excitement about my topic confirmed the value of this story. All of the interviewees said that the story made sense and interested them. One of my goals was to see if the story flowed and made sense to audiences. This goal was met with my questioning, as the responses confirmed the story. Another goal was to see how the story could be made more interesting. I was pleasantly surprised with this feedback, as the ideas were helpful for me. I want to figure out how to balance the feasibility and the value of the suggestions, as time is limited and I want to keep the scope small for this timeline. Interview 1 said I could add some more of my own personal thoughts to the story, which I am reluctant to do. I think that even if I do not add my own opinions, my perspective as someone in the industry will shine through. Another suggestion was to incorporate the global market for musical films. Although this is very interesting to me, I do not think it is very feasible with the time I have. I do have a visualization comparing international vs. domestic box office data, but this is the most I will be able to explore with the time I have. 

From the feedback, I think the main area of improvement is how I tell the story for the general audience. The interviews told me that my message is geared towards people in my industry, which the majority of my audience will not be. I need to tailor the message of the story to better engage the general audience. The people I spoke to were very interested in my topic and thought it told a cool story, but I want to adjust the call to action. 

# Identified Changes for Part III

Using the feedback from my interviews, I have created a to-do list. I ordered these ideas from most to least important or necessary for the success of this story. I created this list with a focus on feasibility compared to the value of the idea. I do not want to add too much to the story at this point in the process. 

To-Do List
1. Finalize data visualizations: domestic v. international box office data, history of musical films, critical acclaim of musical films at award ceremonies, musical box office data before and after film version's release, musical vs. film album recording sales, and genre based data tracking
2. Reinforce call to action: This should not be too difficult to complete and will not take too much time. I just need to combine the feedback from above with my own finalized story to create an effective ending message
3. Adding more data: Incorporate genre-based statistics for musical films in the box office
4. Rework official title of the story: create a more interesting title to engage audience. This should not be very difficult and will not be too time-consuming

I think that this is a sufficient list of tasks for me to complete before part 3. Once I make these changes and finalize all the details of my shorthand, the story should be much more effective for audiences of all backgrounds.
