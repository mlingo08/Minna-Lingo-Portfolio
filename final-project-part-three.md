# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

After the completion of part 2, I had to go through and finalize most of my data visualizations. Using the feedback from my interviews, I wanted to make my story more reliant on the data instead of text. The interviews showed me that my classmates were interested in my story even if they did not know much about the context. There are very few MEIM students in the course, so I had to tailor the material to my audience. Therefore, I decided to include an additional data visualization that I had originally planned to remove from the final product. This graphic shows the popularity of musical soundtrack recordings for films vs. the stage production. I decided to keep this graph in as a way to provide more data-based proof for my call to action.
Another change I made for this final deliverable is the layout of the chapters. Originally I had split the story into about 6 sections, but I ended up splitting it into 4 groups for simplicity. I also named this sections based on the theme of the story as a way to engage the audience and present a more detail-oriented storyline. 

## The audience

The audience for this presentation remained fairly consistent, with a focus on development executives at film studios. This makes the most sense content wise, as I am pushing these individuals to make the choice of producing more musical films. However, I was surprised that my interviews told me that they were also interested in this subject. Therefore, I decided that the audience for this project could be split into a general and a professional group. The professional group would remain the same as my original plan, but there could also be a more general audience of moviegoers or fans of content. This audience is also important, as the decisions made at the executive level are greatly influenced by the choices of everyday people. If this general audience is more willing to support theatre, then executives will be more interested in using their resources to produce musical films. 


# Final thoughts

This was a unique challenge for me, but I am proud that I was able to create something. I do not come from a technical or data-driven background, so this course was the first time I have ever done many of these tasks. Although I wish I could be as creative or technically intelligent as some of my peers, I tried my best to create a storyline with compelling data. I wish I had more time to explore genre-based data, but I used a lot of time trying to work with tableau or shorthand. However, this course has provided me with a lot of knowledge that I can take into my next project, which will give me even more time to create the project I want. 
Although I feel like I have a lot of experience with storytelling, this project challenged me to tell a story with less words and with more reliance on visuals. Data tells a story that can be just as, if not more, effective than words, which is something I never would have guessed before taking this course and completing this project.
