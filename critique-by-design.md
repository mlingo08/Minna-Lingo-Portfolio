Critique and Redesign


_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique

When I first saw this graphic, I was interested in redesigning it because I felt like it was valuable data not being used in the correct way. Because I am studying entertainment management, I am particularly interested in social media usage by populations. The color usage in the graph is effective, but can be hard to distinguish, especially at the bottom where it’s too faint. The title is clear and simple, which works well. My main issue is the change in survey mode in 2022, which makes the data inconsistent and hard to compare. I also wish we had data for each application every year to make the graphic more reliable. That's why I rated completeness as a 4. Based on the graphic and Pew Research's info, the tool is useful for adult social media users in the U.S., which I rated at 8 for usefulness. The graphic clearly shows YouTube as the most used app, but I don't think it encourages deeper thinking. Currently, the research does not inspire further thought processes on social media, which I would like to eventually accomplish. 

At this early point in my redesign process, I’d either remove or separate the post-2022 data, brighten the colors, adjust the y-axis to increase by 10s, remove platforms with minimal data like Nextdoor and BeReal, and widen the graph for clarity. The current graph isn’t terrible, but it could be much clearer and informative with some changes.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

My first sketch was a simple attempt at using the same general shape and data from the original research and making small changes.

For this visualization, I refocused the title on "Youtube has the most users compared to other social media platforms." I analyzed four of the top social media platforms: Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and X. By tracking these four common apps, I was able to show how much of an advantage Youtube has over other platforms. I also focused the data on only the first method of surveying, since I have issues with the change in methodology after 2022. I used bright colors frequently attributed to these platforms to make the survey easy to follow. 


## Step four: Test the solution

I began my testing process in class when paired with two other students. I was able to discuss my original design with a MISM student and a MSPPM-DA student. This allowed me to discuss my sketches and plan with two people of different backgrounds.

Questions that I asked in my surveys:

- Can you tell me what you think this graph is showing?

- Who do you think the intended audience is for this data design?

- Is there anything you would immediately change with my sketch?

- Would another chart with demographic information add to this research in any way?


Results: 

For the discussion of these results, the MISM student will be student 1 and MSPPM will be student 2. 

The results from the survey showed that my sketch was effective, but not particularly interesting. Student 1 noted that the graph was easy to read and follow, as the design was simple and clear. This student also said that it didn't seem like I had made enough changes to my original source. They said that the intended audience was most likely US based social media users, which was correct. For the demographic question, this student was interested in how the data could be compared to ages of users to tell a different story.

Student 2 studies public policy, so they were less concerned about the data and design of the graphic, and more concerned about the story the graph was showing. They felt like I should refocus my research on a story about demographics instead of just generally showing platform usage. 


Synthesis: 

After speaking with the students, I knew what I wanted to create for my final solution. I decided that a grouped bar graph would be an effective way to tell my story. I would take the top 5 social media platforms in 2024 and show how usage differed amongst different age groups. This data was given alongside other demographic information on the original data source. The demographic information was collected in 2024, which is why I took the top 5 apps in 2024, as well. 

Here is a very rough sketch of my initial idea for the final solution:

## Step five: build the solution

My final visualization is shown below.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1743564902660');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

I was able to successfully create a new data visualization focusing on age groups and their usage of social media. I organized the bars from most to least popular
