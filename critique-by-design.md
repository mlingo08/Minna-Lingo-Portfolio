Critique and Redesign


_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique

When I first saw this graphic, I was interested in redesigning it because I felt like it was valuable data not being used in the correct way. Because I am studying entertainment management, I am particularly interested in social media usage by populations. The color usage in the graph is effective, but can be hard to distinguish, especially at the bottom where it’s too faint. The title is clear and simple, which works well. My main issue is the change in survey mode in 2022, which makes the data inconsistent and hard to compare. I also wish we had data for each application every year to make the graphic more reliable. That's why I rated completeness as a 4. Based on the graphic and Pew Research's info, the tool is useful for adult social media users in the U.S., which I rated at 8 for usefulness. The graphic clearly shows YouTube as the most used app, but I don't think it encourages deeper thinking. Currently, the research does not inspire further thought processes on social media, which I would like to eventually accomplish. 

At this early point in my redesign process, I’d either remove or separate the post-2022 data, brighten the colors, adjust the y-axis to increase by 10s, remove platforms with minimal data like Nextdoor and BeReal, and widen the graph for clarity. The current graph isn’t terrible, but it could be much clearer and informative with some changes.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

My first sketch was a simple attempt at using the same general shape and data from the original research and making small changes.

For this visualization, I refocused the title on "Youtube has the most users compared to other social media platforms." I analyzed four of the top social media platforms: Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and X. By tracking these four common apps, I was able to show how much of an advantage Youtube has over other platforms. I also focused the data on only the first method of surveying, since I have issues with the change in methodology after 2022. I used bright colors frequently attributed to these platforms to make the survey easy to follow. 


## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
